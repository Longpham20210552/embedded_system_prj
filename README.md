A project of embedded system design
Acquired sensor data periodically and displayed it via serial or LCD interface. 
Implemented single-task scheduling to handle sensor reading, data logging, and display in a loop.
Enhanced system responsiveness by upgrading to multitasking scheduler, separating sensor reading and display handling into parallel tasks (using RTOS or timer interrupts).
